# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website. I built it using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The site is scroll-based, so each section shows up one at a time with smooth transitions and animations.  

## Sections
- **Home**: Short intro and navigation links  
- **About Me**: My background and goals as an NJIT SDET student  
- **Projects**: Three projects with descriptions and GitHub links  
- **Skills**: Languages, databases, and other strengths  
- **Contact**: Email and GitHub profile

2. [Data Manipulation Projects](https://github.com/jaz35-hue/data-manipulation-projects)

This portfolio is a way to share who I am, what I’m learning, and the projects I’ve worked on so far.
